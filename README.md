# Foodie-Walk

Foodie walk was the first game I first developed during my current job as "Game Development".

It basically works on basic game principle of giving customer item he wants and get paid, do it in time allotted or the customer will be angry.

This game is built in Unity and C#, and is rich with various concepts, including "Ray Caste", "Transformations" etc.

During gameplay a customer will come to the place and ask for a random object that you have in your store, you have got what he wants, keep it in a plate and server him.

Looks easy!!! but it won't be if you have 10 seconds to give him and three customers demanding at a time. Plus, if you provide them in time you will get 5 points, but if you fail you lose 3 points. Another twist is if you try to dispose any object you don't want, you will lose 4 points.

So by the law of the game you have more chances of loosing a point than earning it.
